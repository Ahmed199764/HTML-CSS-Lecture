## Serif 
Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.
In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read.
SanS-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
Screens have a lower resolution than print. So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.
monoSpace
Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)
Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier to follow. imi
